A simple app.js file.

-----------------Dockerfile--------------------
FROM node:alpine // alpine is linux os. we used node from linux alpine
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
CMD node app.js
-----------------------------------------------
Now we will build a image for our application.

docker build -t hello-world .  //tag and Dockerfile location

//if we want to build a image from container we use docker commit

Now from anywhere if we run = docker run hello-world
it will run the whole as everything is in that image 


To use it in another pc we will use = docker pull toky/hello-world 
then we will run = docker run hello-world

if we want to enter the running container we use 
docker exec -it -u root 8c6 sh  // already running container
But we can also start a container in interactive mode
docker run -it ubuntu // we logged in as root user
docker rmi  //for image remove




pwd //path of directory
whoami // user show
echo $0 //show location of shell program
history // see all commands with numbering
!2 //2nd one will run



apt update //to update database of packages
apt-install nano
nano file1.txt
write something and exit .
cat file1.txt > file2.txt 
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
echo hello world > file3.txt

cat file1.txt //show whole file
less file1.txt //show 15% at first or any % then we can see more
head -n 5 file1.txt  // show 1st 5 lines 
tail -n 5 file1.txt // show last 5 lines

ctrl+l //clear terminal window of linux 
apt remove nano // remove installed package


cd ~ //take to home directory which is even below root
mkdir test
ls
mv test docker
ls //will show only docker 
cd docker 
touch hello.txt go.txt me.txt 
mv hello.txt hello-docker.txt //rename hello.txt 
rm file*
cd ~
rm -r docker //to remove directory we use -r
